This is my custom study tool created for the CEMC Math Contests run by the University of Waterloo. With a lot of experience in these contests, I've struggled with using the existing tools from Waterloo to practice. Just viewing old contests hasn’t been enough. The current system doesn’t track accuracy, offer feedback, show topics for each question, or make it easy to access answers. The problem set generator also hasn’t been very helpful. Finding answers still requires going through each individual contest manually!

So I started working on my own tool that contains the past 12 years of questions (more than is publicly accessible through Waterloo's own tools!). This system adapts to you, prioritizing topics based on time spent, accuracy, and question difficulty. It keeps track of all your stats, shows immediate feedback after answering questions, and gives feedback on your answers using AI (for contests like the Fryer, where participants are expected to write out their solution). It also supports saving your stats and learning adaptations between devices using email links to login. 

The scraping scripts are written in Python. The code here does have to cleaned up. The main codebase for the site is written with SvelteKit using Typescript, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN. The backend is using Supabase, but the data is stored local-first, with backups to Supabase when available.
